/// - `Base` is a `has_view == false` primitive shape (e.g. `Control`/`Rectangle`, `is_virtual_builtin`):
///   `Name` must write its own `view` whose root literally constructs `Base` (checked by
///   `validate_inherits`; there is no view-synthesis fallback for an omitted one). `Name` inherits
///   `Base`'s fields the usual bare-reference way (`resolve_effective_fields`), and — because the
///   root construction matches `Base` exactly — `codegen.rs`'s `generate_view` additionally
///   generates `Name`'s struct with a real `base: <BaseImpl>` field (`elwindui_core::tree`'s own
///   trait+`Impl`+`base` convention, docs/elwindui_spec.md 付録H.2.1a) and a direct
///   `impl UIElement`/`impl <Base's own trait>` delegating to it, instead of the generic "wrapper
///   owning a separately-`Rc`-erased root" every other `view`-having component uses. See
///   `codegen.rs`'s `generate_view` `is_shape_composition` doc comment for why this is deliberately
///   narrow (`RoundedPanel inherits Rectangle`, `ContentControl inherits Control`).
/// - `Base` has its own `view` (a logical component, builtin or user-defined) that isn't one of the
///   virtual-builtin shapes above: `Name` inherits `Base`'s fields *and* its `view` as a default
///   template — if `Name` defines its own `view`, that's a full override (no constraint on its root
///   element; see the *code*-reuse sub-case below), otherwise `Base`'s `view` is cloned with the
///   target renamed to `Name`. That template-reuse (no-own-`view`) sub-case gets real `base`
///   composition too, transitively, whenever `Base` is itself already composed (`LabeledPanel
///   inherits ContentControl`, `TypeInfo::composed_shape`/`codegen.rs`'s `resolve_composed_shape`):
///   `Name`'s struct embeds a real `base: Base` field, built by calling `Base`'s own
///   `create_<snake case>(..)` factory (which every composed component exposes, precisely so a
///   *further* derived one can call it directly — see `generate_view`'s `is_template_composition`).
///   A `Name` that instead defines its *own* `view` reusing `Base`'s *code* rather than its structure
///   (`Derived inherits Base`, both independently rooted, `#[override] fn`/`base::name(...)`) keeps
///   the original field-flattening/`__base_<name>` shadow-method mechanism unchanged — there's no
///   live `Base` instance to compose over there, only its method *bodies* to reuse (no different from
///   `super.method()` in a mainstream OOP language never needing a freestanding `super` object).
/// - `Base` is a native-backed leaf with no generated Rust (e.g. `Button`) — inheriting it is a
///   validation error; there's nothing to delegate to.
///
/// `Name`'s own `fields`/`methods` may redeclare a same-named inherited `#[computed]` field or
